# SlurmStats
Script to parse through sacct outputs

Feel free to update and improve!

There is some documentation on sacct here:  https://ohsu-cedar-comp-hub.github.io/ 

If you have questions about the sacct and efficiency, start with the web or the reference above. Slurm has pretty decent documentation.

If you have questions about the code - let me know! It's not pressure tested, and there's a decent chance that something will break when you run it.
